        <p>
          I am Santhosh Naidu Patibandla. I recently completed my Bachelors in
          Computer Science in India. For better exposure and learning
          opportunities, I decided to pursue my Masters in Computer Science in
          the United States. After doing some research, I decided to join
          Portland State University for doing graduate studies, and now I feel
          like I took a wonderful decision as it is an amazing place to learn
          and grow.
