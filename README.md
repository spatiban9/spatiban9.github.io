## Santhosh Naidu Patibandla – Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website, which is created as part of the CS 463/563 Final Project at Portland State University. It showcases about me, my previous work experiences, projects I worked on, and a contact form to connect with me. I used HTML, JavaScript and CSS to develop this website and I designed it with a focus on accessibility, and responsiveness.
